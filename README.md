# Soil-Water-Physics

This is a collection of examples about soil water physics. The notebooks are intended to accompany the lecture at TU Berakademie Freiberg.

## 1. Soil water potentials
The first notebook looks at soil water potentials and the central question of soil water redistribution based on gradient depletion. We use the package CMF https://philippkraft.github.io/cmf to solve the richards equation in a 1D soil column. We experiment with different soil parameters, initial states and boundary conditions.

## 2. Soil hydraulic models
The second notebook dives into applications of different soil hydraulic models. We fit the models to measured soil water retention data and explore their specifics and capabilities.
