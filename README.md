# Soil-Water-Physics

This is a collection of examples about soil water physics. The notebooks are intended to accompany the lecture at TU Berakademie Freiberg.

## 0. Zero to starter with Python
The preparatory notebook introduces how to use the notebooks and how data can be arranged and plotted.

## 1. Soil hydraulic models
The first notebook reads observed soil water retantion data and dives into applications of different soil hydraulic models. We fit the models to measured soil water retention data and explore their specifics and capabilities.

## 2. Soil water potentials
The second notebook looks at soil water potentials and the central question of soil water redistribution based on gradient depletion. We use the package CMF https://philippkraft.github.io/cmf to solve the richards equation in a 1D soil column. We experiment with different soil parameters, initial states and boundary conditions.

## 3. Solute Transport
The third notebook presents a simple analytical solute transport example to play with the parameters.

## 4. Random Walk Examples
The fouth notebook illustrates how random walks can nicely simulate advection-dispersion-processes.
